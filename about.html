            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello and thank-you for visiting my website! My name is Emily, and I am a protege developer for MYOB. I am currently studying coding at Coder Academy, as part of MYOB's DevelopHer Scholarship Program, for which I was fortunate to gain a place this year. Previous to coding, I have been an instrumental music teacher, and a customer service representative at MYOB. In my spare time, I love sewing clothes and teddy bears, knitting, and crocheting. Learning to code is a challenge, but also a lot of fun, and I can't wait to see where it may take me in the future. </p>
